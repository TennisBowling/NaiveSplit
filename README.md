PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY TOKENS TO ANY OF THE CONTRACTS APART FROM THE ERC-20 NAIVESPLIT ONES. SUCC/ABSORBCONTRACTFUNDS WILL </u> NOT <u/> WORK!

at no point in time are funds held in the contract with correct `pay()` calling. they are taken in and send at the same time in 1 transaction.

# using

Etherscan: go to the mainnet or testnet link above,

click on contract, then write contract
make sure to click the ```connect to web3``` and connect your wallet.

now in the payableamout (first box) enter the amount of ether to be evenly distributed.
in the second box (addresses) type in the addresses that you would like to send the eth to. separte the addresses with a comma:

EXAMPLE: 0xC3AaE58Ab81663872dd36d73613eb295b167F546, 0xC3AaE58Ab81663872dd36d73613eb295b167F546

Then click write! if nothing happened, you entered something wrong. if metamask pops up and says ALERT: ERROR, cancel the transaction, you entered something wrong. if metamask pops up with no alerts or errors, go ahead! confirm the transaction. now just wait for it to confirm.
